Java LSP settings

NOTE: some value in `settings.lua` file may need to instead with your own special value, like `home` `runtimes` `maven.globalSettings`

Don't use [mason.nvim](https://github.com/williamboman/mason.nvim) java-test package, it's not compatible with jdtls version 1.28.0 and above. Recommand build it from the official repo for now
